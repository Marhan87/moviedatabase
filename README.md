# moviedatabase
An application for searching through a movie database and display movies accordingly, coding challenge for devoteam.


to run this application simply head to your console of preference, cd into the project itself and type npm install followed by npm run dev and things should come along smoothly.

The things remaining to be done for this one is implement unit testing and implement a search on clicking the dropdown for the autocomplete, but not for lack of trying. I would appreciate if we could have a discussion on how to best implement these features in the application the way i wrote it. Or indeed if you find improvements that can be made to how i decided to do things. 

I look forward to hearing from you soon.
